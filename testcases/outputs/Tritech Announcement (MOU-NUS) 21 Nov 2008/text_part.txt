MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

The Board of Directors of Tritech Group Limited (the "Company") wishes to announce that the Company has on 21 November 2008 (the "Effective Date") entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding ("MOU") with the National University of Singapore ("NUS"), whereby the parties agreed, inter alia, to: 

(i) collaborate in research in the areas of engineering, environment, water, and material science; and

(ii) cooperate in promoting commercialization of technologies in the areas of engineering, environment, water, and material science.

All intellectual property held by either party prior to entering into the MOU or disclosed or introduced in connection with the MOU and all materials in which such intellectual property is held, disclosed, or introduced shall remain the property of the party introducing or disclosing it. Subject thereto, the arrangements in relation to intellectual property shall be agreed separately for each program of cooperation.

The MOU will be in force for a period of five years from the Effective Date, save that either party may terminate the MOU at any time by not less than twelve months' notification to the other party in writing of its desire to terminate the MOU. The parties also agreed to jointly review the collaboration envisaged by the MOU in the six months preceding the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date. The termination of the MOU shall not, however, affect the continued implementation of the programs established under it prior to such termination. The MOU can also be extended in writing by mutual agreement of both parties.

Shareholders of the Company and other investors should note that there is no assurance that definitive agreement(s) will be entered into between the parties in relation to the matters contemplated under the MOU, as the MOU is a non-binding expression of the intentions of the parties as at the Effective Date, save for specified clauses including, inter alia, clauses on intellectual property, confidentiality, the term of the MOU, and dispute resolution.

Save for our independent director, Professor Yong Kwet Yew, who is a Professor of Civil Engineering and Vice President of NUS, none of the Directors or substantial shareholders of the Company has any interest, direct or indirect, in the MOU. Professor Yong Kwet Yew was not involved in giving any recommendation in respect of the MOU or in any discussions or negotiations leading to the signing of the MOU.
